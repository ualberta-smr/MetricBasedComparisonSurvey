# MetricBasedComparisonSurvey

This repository contains survey data collected as part of our work in the paper "An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons of Software Libraries". The contents of this repository are the following:

The ComparisonTables folder contains a screenshot of the metric-based comparison of each of our 10 subject domains, as participants of our survey saw it on our website.

The Plots folder contains individual plots for the ratings of each of our 9 metrics across the different domains. Additionally, the ClassifierComparison image provides a comparison of the different classification algorithms that we tried, and the MostSelectedLibraries image shows a table with the most selected libraries by participants per domain.

The list of subject libraries can be found in the file List of Final Subject Java Libraries.xlsx

The metric data that we extracted for our subject libraries can be found in the file Metric Data for Subject Libraries.xlsx. The metric data was extracted in the month of January, 2018.

Statistical tests performed for RQ1 and RQ2 of our paper can be found in the Scripts folder.
