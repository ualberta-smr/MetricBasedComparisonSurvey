# MetricBasedComparisonSurvey

This repository contains survey data collected as part of our work in the paper **An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons of Software Libraries**, which can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/v5hdbnywsycvt1q/LopezDeLaMoraPROMISE18.pdf). The contents of this repository are the following:

# Contents
- The `ComparisonTables` folder contains a screenshot of the metric-based comparison of each of our 10 subject domains, as participants of our survey saw it on our website.
- The `Plots` folder contains individual plots for the ratings of each of our 9 metrics across the different domains. Additionally, the `ClassifierComparison` image provides a comparison of the different classification algorithms that we tried, and the `MostSelectedLibraries` image shows a table with the most selected libraries by participants per domain.
- The list of subject libraries can be found in the file `List of Final Subject Java Libraries.xlsx`
- The metric data that we extracted for our subject libraries can be found in the file `Metric Data for Subject Libraries.xlsx`. The metric data was extracted in the month of January, 2018. This data was extracted using the PROMISE2018 release of the scripts in the repository linked [here](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/LibraryMetricScripts)
- Statistical tests performed for RQ1 and RQ2 of our paper can be found in the `Scripts` folder.
